# moosage - üêÆ

A cow-themed chat system, implemented in Rust using gRPC.

Mostly meant to learn more about [`tonic`](https://crates.io/crates/tonic), [`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) and [`tracing`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing).

# Demo

1. Start the server:
    - `cargo run -p moosage-server`
2. Start the client:
    - `cargo run -p moosage-client`
3. Send a message:
    - Send a message using something like [`bloomrpc`](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc)

# crates

### [moosage-common](./moosage-common)

Contains the gRPC proto files, as well being responsible for generating rust code for the gRPC services/messages.

### [moosage](./moosage)

The server implementation of `moosage`.

Clients can subscribe to a stream of messages.

Clients can send messages, which are then broadcast to every client which subscribed to the stream of messages.
